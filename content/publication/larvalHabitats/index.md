abstract: In Amazonian Peru, the primary malaria vector, **Nyssorhynchus darlingi** (formerly **Anopheles darlingi**), is difficult to target using standard vector control methods because it mainly feeds and rests outdoors. Larval source management could be a useful supplementary intervention, but to determine its feasibility, more detailed studies on the larval ecology of **Ny. darlingi** are essential. We conducted a multi-level study of the larval ecology of Anophelinae mosquitoes in the peri-Iquitos region of Amazonian Peru, examining the environmental characteristics of the larval habitats of four species, comparing the larval microbiota among species and habitats, and placing **Ny. darlingi** larval habitats in the context of spatial heterogeneity in human malaria transmission. We collected **Ny. darlingi, Nyssorhynchus rangeli** (formerly **Anopheles rangeli**), **Nyssorhynchus triannulatus s.l.** (formerly **Anopheles triannulatus s.l.**), and **Nyssorhynchus sp. nr. konderi** (formerly **Anopheles sp. nr. konderi**) from natural and artificial water bodies throughout the rainy and dry seasons. We found that, consistent with previous studies in this region and in Brazil, the presence of **Ny. darlingi** was significantly associated with water bodies in landscapes with more recent deforestation and lower light intensity. **Nyssorhynchus darlingi** presence was also significantly associated with a lower vegetation index, other Anophelinae species, and emergent vegetation. Though they were collected in the same water bodies, the microbial communities of **Ny. darlingi** larvae were distinct from those of **Ny. rangeli** and **Ny. triannulatus s.l.**, providing evidence either for a species-specific larval microbiome or for segregation of these species in distinct microhabitats within each water body. We demonstrated that houses with more reported malaria cases were located closer to **Ny. darlingi** larval habitats; thus, targeted control of these sites could help ameliorate malaria risk. The co-occurrence of **Ny. darlingi** larvae in water bodies with other putative malaria vectors increases the potential impact of larval source management in this region.
