I am a Peruvian Environmental Engineer passionate about research on Landscape Ecology and Remote Sensing of the Environment. I am also interested to investigate the relationship between the environment and infectious diseases with innovative tools that lead us to improve life quality. I'm currently a student of Copernicus Master in Digital Earth, based in the University of Salzburg (Austria) and the University of South Britany (France).

I have experience in Remote Sensing projects using a variety of GIS and programming software such as QGIS, Google Earth Engine (GEE), R, and Python; and I've participated in projects related to remote sensing and infectious diseases such as: the identification of the main malaria vector breeding sites using drone multispectral imagery and Machine Learning algorithms, the assessment of Geographical accessibility to health facilities in Peru, and the use of time series analysis to predict dengue cases in the Peruvian Amazon using Environmental predictors derived from the ECMWF reanalysis, among others.
