I am a Peruvian Environmental Engineer passionate about research on Landscape Ecology and Remote Sensing of the Environment. I am also interested to investigate the relationship between the environment and infectious diseases with innovative tools that lead us to improve life quality. I have trained in the use of remote sensing tools to gather spatially explicit environmental information. As a young researcher, I have experience in Remote Sensing projects using a variety of GIS and programming software such as QGIS, Google Earth Engine (GEE), R, and Python. I have been working as a Research Assistant at the Entomology team of the Amazonia Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (Amazonia ICEMR) performing data management and analysis routines (mainly using R) with an emphasis on Geographical data and the environmental determinants affecting Malaria vectors in the Peruvian Amazon. During this time I have been working on the identification of the main malaria vector breeding sites using drone multispectral imagery and Machine Learning algorithms; here is a GEE app to visualize the results: https://edgarmanrique30.users.earthengine.app/view/tdrclassification. The assessment of Geographical accessibility to health facilities in Peru: https://edgarmanrique30.users.earthengine.app/view/ country-wide-map-of-travel-time-to-health-facilities-for-2018. And the use of time series analysis to predict dengue cases in the Peruvian Amazon using Environmental predictors derived from the ECMWF reanalysis, among other
things.
