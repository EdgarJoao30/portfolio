<h2>Summer School description</h2>
<p>From the 6th to the 8th of April 2022, the Online International Spring School on Visualization took
place Online and was orginized by the department of Geoinformatics at Palacky Olomouc University. The topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>April 6th: Maps in culture and history</li>
<li>April 7th: Maps in Literature, visualising names</li>
<li>April 8th: Virtual PubQuiz</li>
</ul>
<p>Cultural differences among societies have produced also differences in the way the world is view in a cartographic way.
Atlases are meant to comunicate such view of the world, and use maps as arguments. The differences in the atlases
produced in different cultures allows the comparison of different things for the same region, and similar things for
different regions.</p>
<p>The Spring School presented the evolution and importance of maps throughout time and space in history. It also presented
how the usage of maps can benefit in the interpretation of non-map related pieces of work, like literature and cinema.</p>
